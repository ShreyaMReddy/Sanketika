# Building a Sink connector to index Values from Kafka into Elasticsearch via a Flink job.

Set up Apache Flink, Apache Kafka, and Elasticsearch locally.

I have used Docker to set up Apache Flink.

Make sure all versions of Flink, Kafka, and Elasticsearch are compatible with each other.

If using Docker, set up Kafka and Elasticsearch inside the Docker too.

Be careful about port conflicts.
